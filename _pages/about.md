I am a senior undergraduate at Brandeis University, double majoring in Computer Science and Biology. I am currently working as a researcher at VH Lab (Van Hooser Lab), where I study the motion and speed tuning properties in the ferret visual cortex. My research interest lies at the intersection of Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning.
